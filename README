The idea is to add 2048 bits (more or fewer could be added or removed) to the beginning of a file. All 2048 of those bits are 0's. Then, encrypt it with a private key. When decrypted with the right public key, all of the first 2048 bits are 0's, as well as the rest of the plaintext. If decrypting using the wrong public key or decrypting with the right public key the plaintext data that has been encrypted with a private key that doesn't produce that public key, there is a 1 in 22048 chance of the first 2048 bits being all 0's.
