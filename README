The idea is to add 2048 bits (more or fewer could be added or removed) to the beginning of a file. All 2048 of those bits are 0's. Then, encrypt the file with private key A. After decryption with public key A (public key A is generated from private key A), if the first 2048 bits aren't all 0s, then it was not encrypted with private key A, meaning secure boot violation.

I could get hired by say, Intel to work on Intel Boot Guard or AMD to work on AMD PSP.
